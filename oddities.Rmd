### Tissue Identification
Tissues other than gonad may end up in your sample. A cross section of *Eviota susansae*, a small (<5cm goby) showing different types of tissue. Bones have been decalcified prior to histology.

Several different stains are used for fish histological gonad staging.

- Toluidine blue is a thiazine metachromatic dye with high affinity for acidic tissue, staining DNA and cell nuclei darker than other tissues.
