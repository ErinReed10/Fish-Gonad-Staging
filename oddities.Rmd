### Tissue Identification
Tissues other than gonad may end up in your sample. A cross section of *Eviota susansae*, a small (<5cm goby) showing different types of tissue. Bones have been decalcified prior to histology.

### Staining 

Several different stains are used for fish histological gonad staging. 
A good reference to compare and explore staines is the [Education Guide: Special Stains and H & E Second Edition](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.agilent.com/cs/library/technicaloverviews/public/08066_special_stains_eduguide.pdf). Editors: Kumar, G. L. and J. A. Kiernan eds. This is a guide to stains that is not fish specific.


Below are some examples of the same reproductive phase with different stains.

- Hematoxylin and eosin is one of the most common stains. Hematoxylin stains cell nuclei and DNA a purplish blue and eosin stains cytoplasm and extracellular matrix pink.

- Toluidine blue is a thiazine metachromatic dye with high affinity for acidic tissue, staining DNA and cell nuclei darker than other tissues.
